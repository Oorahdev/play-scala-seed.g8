## Running locally

If you are testing this giter8 template locally, you should [install g8](http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/setup.html) and then run the [local test](http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/testing.html) feature:

```bash
g8 file://play-scala-seed.g8/ --name=my-seed-test --force
```

Will create an example template called `my-seed-test`, for example.
